        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <h2><strong>Professional Summary</strong></h2>
        <p>
            As a dedicated Master's student in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity at Boston University, I have charted a unique path in my academic and career journey. Initially targeting a career in business, my undergraduate studies spanned a diverse range of subjects from accounting and financial fundamentals to artificial intelligence and database management. However, during my second year and subsequent exchange in the UK, I pivoted towards computer science, embracing the challenges and rigors this field demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            This transition was fueled by my fascination with cybersecurity, particularly sparked by my exposure to key exchange protocols. This interest led to my undergraduate project on "Key Exchange using Neural Networks," reflecting my belief in the paramount importance of cybersecurity in our AI-driven era. Despite the steep learning curve, the sense of achievement from mastering new skills in computer science as an "outsider" has been immensely rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long-term, I aspire to be a proficient penetration tester, staying ahead of evolving cyber threats and contributing to the development of secure digital environments. Before reaching this milestone, I seek to gain diverse work experience through internships, eager to join a dynamic team where I can both contribute and grow. I firmly believe that experiences in team collaboration will be an invaluable asset in my career journey.
